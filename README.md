This repo includes a few nifty things, it

  - ...is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
  - ...auto deploys to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on changes to `master`
  - ...hooks up with [forestry](https://forestry.io/) for a CMS like UX
  - ...uses [vivus](https://maxwellito.github.io/vivus/) to "draw" the SVG
 
 Now you know. Go build something!
