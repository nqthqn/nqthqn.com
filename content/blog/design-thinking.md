**The Idea:**
Many times in a design feedback session creative people will start with divergent thinking â€” "Here are all the possible options" 

**The Trouble:**
Frustration arises when interlocutors fail to recognize when they are doing convergent thinking or divergent thinking. Someone in a convergent thinking mode might say "that option is impractical" which would sound frustrating to someone in a divergent mode.

**The Fix:**
Have time for both! And recognize which mode you and your interlocutor are in.
