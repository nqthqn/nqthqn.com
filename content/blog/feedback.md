title: "On Feedback"

Now, in regard to the need for feedback to be given intentionally we ought to keep a couple concepts in mind. Feedback on a design, a process, an algorithm, a user experience can be categorized into 3 buckets,

1. Reactionary
2. Directional
3. Objective

**Reactionary feedback** would be something along the liners of "Wow, I hate the color purple"

**Directional feedback** might sound like "Please do not use that color combo, we need to remember to empathize with color-blind users"

**Objective feedback** steps back and considers the goal, for example "75% of customers in our A/B test selected purple at checkout, therefore, we want to make money, therefore, let's go with purple"

Understanding what type of feedback you are receiving will help drive the conversation forward and hopefully get you unstuck. Another area to address within feedback loops is the concept of divergent and convergent design thinking.

One person might say "Well, that idea is impractical" and potentially shut down an innovative solution. It's important to recognize which mode we are in — are we diverging and exploring a plethora of ideas or are we attempting to look at tradeoffs and converge on an optimal outcome?

Let's remind each other of the type of feedback we are giving or receiving (reactionary, directional or objective) and which thinking mode we are in (convergent or divergent).

This — in theory — should reduce friction in an interdisciplinary context. And help us build cool shit in a fun way.
