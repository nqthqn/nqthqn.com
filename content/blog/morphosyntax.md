This is a working draft. I am taking a linguistics course. Here are a handful of class notes I am compiling. We are partaking in the analysis of grammar.

1. **Morphology**: the forms of words
2. **Syntax**: ordering of words into larger groupings like phrases and clauses

"cats" is constructed from cat and -s plural. The meaning units of **going to** get smooshed together: **gonna**. orthography demands we write them separately.

## What kinds of questions do we ask in linguistics?

1. How are words formed?
2. How are phrases and clauses structured?
3. How are clauses structured semantically? *transitive, case forms, semantic roles, tense, aspect, mood*
4. And Syntactically? *alignment, valence, clause combining*

## How do we analyze?

1. muck around in the data
2. form a hypothesis *finding a pattern is a hypothesis!*
3. test that hypothesis *make sure pattern holds*
4. revise that hypothesis *make a change*
5. develop a beautiful analysis *tell a story of the pattern*
