## The Idea
Design feedback sessions often begin with divergent thinking, wherein multiple options are considered. Divergent thinking can be an effective approach to creative problem-solving.

## The Trouble
Difficulties arise when interlocutors fail to recognize the divergent and convergent modes of thinking. Feedback in a convergent mode, which involves narrowing options, can be frustrating to those engaged in divergent thinking.

## The Fix
To improve the feedback process, it is essential to allocate time for both modes of thinking and to be mindful of which mode is being used. Integrating divergent and convergent thinking provides more comprehensive solutions and facilitates better design outcomes.

## Combining Convergent and Divergent Thinking
The integration of convergent and divergent thinking is vital for designers. Transitions between modes can be challenging, but ultimately lead to more effective solutions. Taking a break or shifting the focus of the discussion can help reset the mind for a new approach.

## Tips for Shifting Between Modes
In order to optimize the feedback process, it is necessary to combine convergent and divergent thinking. Shifting between modes requires attention and intentionality. Recognizing which mode is being utilized, and communicating feedback effectively, will help create optimal design outcomes.

Imagine a tree with different branches. At the end of each branch is an option. This tree is the conversation we have when diverging and converging in conversation only here, we are climbing. It can feel difficult to switch to different limbs when people are climbing different sections of the tree.
