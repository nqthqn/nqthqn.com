 - `ysiw"` surround word in "quotes", `cs'"` change surrounding `'` to `"` 'like'
 - `:%g!/^(/d` across the whole file (`%`) run a command (`g`) on any line that does not (`!`) start with `(` (`g!/^(`) â€” in this case the command is delete (`d`)

 - `D` delete till end of line
 - `di"` delete in quotes 
 - `%` jump to matching brace, `V%`, visually select until matching brace
 - `x` delete char. better then forward delete, block cursor
 - Map shortcuts in normal mode `nmap <leader>t gg` 
 - `dtT` delete until T
 - `gg=G` auto intent a file (sometimes works)
 - `]c` and `[c` next and previous git hunk (use with git-gutter plugin)
 - `\hs` stage current hunk
 - `T` is like `t` but backwards, `dt{` means delete until {

 - `*` search for word that you are currently on

 - Marks
 - `mm` set a mark called m on the line
 - backtick `m` to go to mark called m
 - `:r !date` to insert todays date on next line
 - `Shift K` shows documentation for the thing under the cursor
 - `:h f` taught me about the `f` motion, `f"` takes me to the :ext " on the current line
 - `inoremap " ""<left>` maps `"` in insert mode to `""` with the cursor between the `""`
