Well good morning it again here we are beautiful day today's workout is brought to you by the Fibonacci sequence should be fun. Fibonacci sequence it's such that each number is the sum of the two proceeding numbers starting from zero and one so zero plus one is one one plus one is two one plus two is three two, plus three is five and so on kind of interesting. 

So let's go ahead and get started. As usual. Limber up get loose move your arms around jogger on the living room, don't forget to drink some water hydrate great, hopefully you've done that already go ahead and swing your right arm around one times two times three times and you're left arm around one times two times three times now let's do some jumping jacks one, two, three, four. 

Five great and some air squats one. Two. Three. Four. Five, maybe you're feeling the burn from yesterday's leg workout. All right without further ado, let's go ahead and get into the workout so first you'll want to do zero seconds of a plank so you'll get into a push of position get down on your elbows on your forearms rather and keep your for this this is called a plank exercise so you want to keep your back nice and and straight and flat just like, you know, just like some kind of object that is straightened and flat if you can imagine something that would be like that and then go to encounter zero. 

And then do zero sit-ups and zero push-ups, okay great you're done we're not even take a break all right now now let's do one second so go ahead and one Mississippi plank great now flip over one sit up. Did you do it good hopefully that was enough time to do one sit up?
